Once upon a time, a farmer had a goose that laid a golden egg every day. The egg provided
enough money for the farmer and his wife for their day-to-day needs. The farmer and his
wife were happy for a long time. But one day, the farmer got an idea and thought, “Why
should I take just one egg a day? Why can’t I take all of them at once and make a lot of
money?”
